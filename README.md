# hangman_turtle🎨🐢

This is a simple fun game made with turtle as visualizer you have lives being printed on terminal whereas hang man is drawn on turtle screen, I have used a words list from stack overflow to choose random word, if it is correct it gets printed on top of turtle screen at correct places with dashes as not found ones, it does'nt have checks for characters or anything, which needs improvement.😅

## This is how it looks
